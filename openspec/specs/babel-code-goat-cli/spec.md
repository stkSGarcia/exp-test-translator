## Purpose

Defines the Babel Code Goat CLI contract for generating language-specific tester files and running translated tests from a constrained `tests.py` format.

## Requirements

### Requirement: CLI Commands and Language Validation
The system SHALL provide `generate <tests_dir> --entrypoint <entrypoint> --lang <target_lang> [flags...]` and `test <solution_path> <tests_dir> --lang <target_lang> [flags...]` commands. The system MUST accept only `python`, `javascript`, and `typescript` as target languages.

#### Scenario: Generate accepts a supported language
- **WHEN** `generate` is invoked with an existing tests directory, a valid entrypoint, and `--lang python`, `--lang javascript`, or `--lang typescript`
- **THEN** the command validates the language and proceeds with generation for that target

#### Scenario: Generate rejects an unsupported language
- **WHEN** `generate` is invoked with any `--lang` value other than `python`, `javascript`, or `typescript`
- **THEN** the command exits non-zero and does not create or modify `tester.py`, `tester.js`, or `tester.ts`

#### Scenario: Test rejects an unsupported language
- **WHEN** `test` is invoked with any `--lang` value other than `python`, `javascript`, or `typescript`
- **THEN** the command prints exactly `{"status":"error","passed":[],"failed":[]}` as one stdout line and exits with code 2

### Requirement: Tester File Generation
The system SHALL write the expected tester file in `<tests_dir>` when `generate` succeeds. The expected tester filename MUST be `tester.py` for `python`, `tester.js` for `javascript`, and `tester.ts` for `typescript`.

#### Scenario: Generate writes a Python tester
- **WHEN** `generate <tests_dir> --entrypoint solve --lang python` succeeds
- **THEN** `<tests_dir>/tester.py` exists and the command exits with code 0

#### Scenario: Generate writes a JavaScript tester
- **WHEN** `generate <tests_dir> --entrypoint solve --lang javascript` succeeds
- **THEN** `<tests_dir>/tester.js` exists and the command exits with code 0

#### Scenario: Generate writes a TypeScript tester
- **WHEN** `generate <tests_dir> --entrypoint solve --lang typescript` succeeds
- **THEN** `<tests_dir>/tester.ts` exists and the command exits with code 0

### Requirement: Generation Failure Preserves Tester Files
The system MUST NOT create or modify `tester.py`, `tester.js`, or `tester.ts` when `generate` fails for any reason.

#### Scenario: Generate fails before tester exists
- **WHEN** `generate` fails and the expected tester file is absent
- **THEN** the expected tester file remains absent

#### Scenario: Generate fails when tester already exists
- **WHEN** `generate` fails and the expected tester file already exists
- **THEN** the existing tester file content remains unchanged

### Requirement: Test Requires Existing Tester
The system MUST require the expected tester file to already exist before running `test`. The `test` command MUST NOT create or modify the tester file.

#### Scenario: Python tester is missing
- **WHEN** `test <solution_path> <tests_dir> --lang python` is invoked and `<tests_dir>/tester.py` is missing
- **THEN** the command prints exactly `{"status":"error","passed":[],"failed":[]}` as one stdout line and exits with code 2

#### Scenario: JavaScript tester is missing
- **WHEN** `test <solution_path> <tests_dir> --lang javascript` is invoked and `<tests_dir>/tester.js` is missing
- **THEN** the command prints exactly `{"status":"error","passed":[],"failed":[]}` as one stdout line and exits with code 2

#### Scenario: TypeScript tester is missing
- **WHEN** `test <solution_path> <tests_dir> --lang typescript` is invoked and `<tests_dir>/tester.ts` is missing
- **THEN** the command prints exactly `{"status":"error","passed":[],"failed":[]}` as one stdout line and exits with code 2

#### Scenario: Existing tester is preserved during test
- **WHEN** `test` is invoked and the expected tester file exists
- **THEN** the tester file content remains unchanged after the command exits

### Requirement: Test JSON Output and Exit Codes
The `test` command MUST print exactly one line to stdout containing a JSON object with only the keys `status`, `passed`, and `failed`. The status MUST be one of `pass`, `fail`, or `error`; `passed` and `failed` MUST be arrays. The command MUST exit with code 0 for `pass`, code 1 for `fail`, and code 2 for `error`.

#### Scenario: All tests pass
- **WHEN** all discovered tests pass
- **THEN** `test` prints a single JSON line with `status` set to `pass`, all passing test IDs in `passed`, an empty `failed` array, no extra keys, and exits with code 0

#### Scenario: At least one test fails
- **WHEN** at least one discovered test fails after successful discovery
- **THEN** `test` prints a single JSON line with `status` set to `fail`, includes failed test IDs in `failed`, includes passing test IDs in `passed`, no extra keys, and exits with code 1

#### Scenario: Test command errors
- **WHEN** `test` encounters an error condition before successful test execution
- **THEN** `test` prints a single JSON line with `status` set to `error`, no extra keys, and exits with code 2

### Requirement: Test Discovery Source and Allowed Constructs
The system SHALL discover tests from `<tests_dir>/tests.py`. Assertions inside functions MUST count as tests even when the function is not called. The system MUST support allowed non-comment code at any scope consisting of `def ...:` blocks, allowed assertions, and raise-any expectation blocks.

#### Scenario: Assertions inside functions are discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains a function with `assert ENTRYPOINT(args...) == expected`
- **THEN** discovery includes that assertion as a test even if the function is never called

#### Scenario: Supported assertion forms are discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains `assert ENTRYPOINT(args...) == expected`, `assert ENTRYPOINT(args...) != expected`, `assert ENTRYPOINT(args...)`, or `assert not ENTRYPOINT(args...)`
- **THEN** each assertion is discovered as one test

#### Scenario: Raise-any expectation block is discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains `try: ENTRYPOINT(args...); assert False` followed by `except Exception: pass`
- **THEN** the try/except block is discovered as one test that passes only when the entrypoint raises an exception

#### Scenario: Discovery fails
- **WHEN** `tests.py` is missing, cannot be parsed, or contains unsupported test constructs
- **THEN** `test` prints exactly `{"status":"error","passed":[],"failed":[]}` as one stdout line and exits with code 2

### Requirement: Raw Output Expectations
The system MUST support raw stdout and stderr expectations immediately preceding a discovered test. The expectation comments MUST use `# expect_stdout: "<python string literal>"` and `# expect_stderr: "<python string literal>"`, and matching MUST compare exact raw text.

#### Scenario: Stdout expectation matches exactly
- **WHEN** a `# expect_stdout: "<python string literal>"` comment immediately precedes a test
- **THEN** the test passes its stdout expectation only if the entrypoint produces exactly that stdout text for the test

#### Scenario: Stderr expectation matches exactly
- **WHEN** a `# expect_stderr: "<python string literal>"` comment immediately precedes a test
- **THEN** the test passes its stderr expectation only if the entrypoint produces exactly that stderr text for the test

#### Scenario: Output expectation does not match
- **WHEN** a raw stdout or stderr expectation is present and the captured output differs by any character
- **THEN** the corresponding test ID appears in `failed`

### Requirement: Test IDs
Each discovered test ID MUST be based on the 1-based source line where the test originates using the format `tests.py:<line>`. If multiple tests originate from the same source line, IDs MUST append `#0`, `#1`, and subsequent zero-based suffixes so each ID is unique.

#### Scenario: Single test on a line
- **WHEN** one test originates from line 12 of `tests.py`
- **THEN** its test ID is `tests.py:12`

#### Scenario: Multiple tests on one line
- **WHEN** multiple tests originate from line 12 of `tests.py`
- **THEN** their test IDs are `tests.py:12#0`, `tests.py:12#1`, and so on in discovery order

### Requirement: Allowed Values and Equality
The system MUST support `None`, booleans, integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries with string keys as arguments and expected values, including nested containers. Equality and inequality MUST use deep structural comparison for nested containers.

#### Scenario: Nested values are compared structurally
- **WHEN** a discovered equality assertion compares nested lists, tuples, or dictionaries
- **THEN** the test result is based on deep structural equality rather than object identity or string formatting

#### Scenario: Unsupported literal value
- **WHEN** a test argument or expected value uses a value outside the allowed set or a dictionary with a non-string key
- **THEN** discovery fails

### Requirement: Solution Callable Resolution
The code under test MUST be in the same language as the generated tester. The system SHALL call the inferred entrypoint when it is available as a callable named by the entrypoint, as a method with that name on a class constructible with no arguments, or as a static method with that name.

#### Scenario: Callable function is used
- **WHEN** the solution defines a callable named by the inferred entrypoint
- **THEN** the system invokes that callable for each discovered test

#### Scenario: No-argument class method is used
- **WHEN** the solution defines a class constructible with no arguments and that class has a callable method named by the inferred entrypoint
- **THEN** the system constructs the class and invokes the method for each discovered test

#### Scenario: Static method is used
- **WHEN** the solution defines a class with a callable static method named by the inferred entrypoint
- **THEN** the system invokes the static method for each discovered test

### Requirement: Coverage and Execution Outcomes
If tests are discoverable, every discovered test ID MUST appear exactly once in either `passed` or `failed`. Tests not executed for any reason after successful discovery MUST be listed in `failed`. If test discovery fails, the output MUST be exactly `{"status":"error","passed":[],"failed":[]}`.

#### Scenario: Every discovered test is reported
- **WHEN** discovery succeeds and three tests are discovered
- **THEN** each of the three test IDs appears exactly once across the `passed` and `failed` arrays

#### Scenario: A discovered test is not executed
- **WHEN** discovery succeeds but a discovered test cannot be executed
- **THEN** that test ID appears in `failed`

#### Scenario: Discovery failure has empty results
- **WHEN** discovery fails before tests can be enumerated
- **THEN** `test` reports `status` as `error` with empty `passed` and `failed` arrays

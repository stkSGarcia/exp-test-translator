## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Test Default Numeric Tolerance
The `test` command SHALL accept an optional `--tol <float>` flag. When provided, the value MUST become the default absolute numeric tolerance for equality and inequality comparisons involving floats or `decimal.Decimal` values, including values nested inside supported containers. When omitted, numeric equality MUST remain exact unless a per-assert tolerance override is present. Invalid tolerance values MUST be treated as a test command error.

#### Scenario: Default tolerance matches nested float values
- **WHEN** `test <solution_path> <tests_dir> --lang python --tol 0.01` runs a discovered assertion comparing `[1.0, {"x": 2.005}]` with `[1.0, {"x": 2.0}]`
- **THEN** the comparison passes because the nested float difference is within the default tolerance

#### Scenario: Omitted default tolerance preserves exact comparison
- **WHEN** `test <solution_path> <tests_dir> --lang python` runs a discovered assertion comparing `1.001` with `1.0` without a per-assert tolerance override
- **THEN** the comparison fails

#### Scenario: Invalid tolerance errors
- **WHEN** `test <solution_path> <tests_dir> --lang python --tol nope` is invoked
- **THEN** the command prints exactly `{"status":"error","passed":[],"failed":[]}` as one stdout line and exits with code 2

### Requirement: Per-Assert Numeric Tolerance Overrides
The system SHALL discover per-assert numeric tolerance overrides using `math.isclose(ENTRYPOINT(args...), expected, abs_tol=..., rel_tol=...)` and `abs(a - b) < tol` or `abs(a - b) <= tol` where one side of `a - b` is the entrypoint call and the other side is a supported numeric expected value. Per-assert tolerance overrides MUST take precedence over the `test --tol` default for that discovered test. `decimal.Decimal` values MUST participate in these numeric tolerance comparisons.

#### Scenario: Math isclose override is discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains `assert math.isclose(solve(1), 1.01, abs_tol=0.02)`
- **THEN** discovery includes one test that passes when the result is within the assertion's absolute tolerance

#### Scenario: Absolute-difference less-than override is discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains `assert abs(solve(1) - 1.0) < 0.01`
- **THEN** discovery includes one test that passes only when the absolute difference is less than `0.01`

#### Scenario: Absolute-difference less-than-or-equal override is discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains `assert abs(Decimal("1.00") - solve(1)) <= Decimal("0.01")`
- **THEN** discovery includes one test that passes when the absolute difference is less than or equal to `Decimal("0.01")`

#### Scenario: Per-assert tolerance overrides default tolerance
- **WHEN** `test <solution_path> <tests_dir> --lang python --tol 0.5` runs `assert math.isclose(solve(1), 1.0, abs_tol=0.01)`
- **THEN** the test uses `0.01` as its absolute tolerance instead of `0.5`

### Requirement: Typed Exception Expectations
The system SHALL support typed exception expectation blocks in addition to raise-any expectation blocks. Typed exception blocks MUST pass only when the entrypoint raises the expected exception type. When the block asserts a substring check against `str(e)` or a regex check using `re.search(pattern, str(e))`, the message matcher MUST also pass.

#### Scenario: Typed exception with substring match is discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains a `try` block that calls the entrypoint, asserts `False`, and catches `ValueError as e` with `assert "bad" in str(e)`
- **THEN** discovery includes one test that passes only when the entrypoint raises `ValueError` and its message contains `bad`

#### Scenario: Typed exception with regex match is discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` imports `re` and catches `ValueError as e` with `assert re.search(r"bad", str(e))`
- **THEN** discovery includes one test that passes only when the entrypoint raises `ValueError` and its message matches the regex

#### Scenario: Wrong exception type fails typed expectation
- **WHEN** a typed exception expectation catches `ValueError` and the entrypoint raises a different exception type
- **THEN** the discovered test ID appears in `failed`

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Test Discovery Source and Allowed Constructs
The system SHALL discover tests from `<tests_dir>/tests.py`. Assertions inside functions MUST count as tests even when the function is not called. The system MUST support allowed non-comment code at any scope consisting of `def ...:` blocks, restricted helper imports for supported test expressions, allowed assertions, raise-any expectation blocks, and typed exception expectation blocks.

#### Scenario: Assertions inside functions are discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains a function with `assert ENTRYPOINT(args...) == expected`
- **THEN** discovery includes that assertion as a test even if the function is never called

#### Scenario: Supported assertion forms are discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains `assert ENTRYPOINT(args...) == expected`, `assert ENTRYPOINT(args...) != expected`, `assert ENTRYPOINT(args...)`, `assert not ENTRYPOINT(args...)`, a supported `math.isclose(...)` assertion, or a supported `abs(a - b) < tol` / `<= tol` assertion
- **THEN** each assertion is discovered as one test

#### Scenario: Raise-any expectation block is discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains `try: ENTRYPOINT(args...); assert False` followed by `except Exception: pass`
- **THEN** the try/except block is discovered as one test that passes only when the entrypoint raises an exception

#### Scenario: Typed expectation block is discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains `try: ENTRYPOINT(args...); assert False` followed by `except ValueError as e: assert "bad" in str(e)`
- **THEN** the try/except block is discovered as one test that passes only when the entrypoint raises the expected exception type and message

#### Scenario: Restricted helper imports are accepted
- **WHEN** `tests.py` imports `math`, `re`, `collections`, or `decimal`, or imports `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, or `Decimal` from their standard-library modules for use in supported test expressions
- **THEN** discovery treats those imports as allowed helper declarations rather than executable tests

#### Scenario: Discovery fails
- **WHEN** `tests.py` is missing, cannot be parsed, or contains unsupported test constructs
- **THEN** `test` prints exactly `{"status":"error","passed":[],"failed":[]}` as one stdout line and exits with code 2

### Requirement: Allowed Values and Equality
The system MUST support `None`, booleans, integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries with any supported hashable key type, sets, frozensets, `collections.Counter`, `collections.deque`, `collections.defaultdict`, and `decimal.Decimal` as arguments and expected values, including nested containers where the Python type allows nesting. Equality and inequality MUST use deep structural or container-semantic comparison for nested containers. Numeric comparison MUST apply the effective tolerance to floats and `decimal.Decimal` values where tolerance is applicable.

#### Scenario: Nested values are compared structurally
- **WHEN** a discovered equality assertion compares nested lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, frozensets, counters, deques, default dictionaries, or decimals
- **THEN** the test result is based on the nested values' structural or container-semantic equality rather than object identity or string formatting

#### Scenario: Dictionary keys use supported key types
- **WHEN** a discovered assertion uses a dictionary with supported non-string keys such as integers, booleans, tuples, frozensets, or decimals
- **THEN** discovery succeeds and comparison preserves the key values rather than converting them to strings

#### Scenario: Sets and frozensets compare by membership
- **WHEN** a discovered equality assertion compares `set([2, 1])` with `{1, 2}` or `frozenset([2, 1])` with `frozenset([1, 2])`
- **THEN** the comparison passes regardless of member order

#### Scenario: Counter values compare by counts
- **WHEN** a discovered equality assertion compares `Counter({"a": 2, "b": 1})` with `Counter(["a", "a", "b"])`
- **THEN** the comparison passes because the element counts match

#### Scenario: Deque values compare by ordered contents
- **WHEN** a discovered equality assertion compares `deque([1, 2, 3])` with `deque([1, 2, 3])`
- **THEN** the comparison passes because the ordered contents match

#### Scenario: Defaultdict values compare by mapping contents
- **WHEN** a discovered equality assertion compares `defaultdict(int, {"a": 1})` with `defaultdict(list, {"a": 1})`
- **THEN** the comparison passes because the mapping contents match

#### Scenario: Decimal values participate in numeric comparison
- **WHEN** a discovered equality assertion compares `Decimal("1.001")` with `Decimal("1.000")` while the effective tolerance is `0.01`
- **THEN** the comparison passes

#### Scenario: Unsupported literal value
- **WHEN** a test argument or expected value uses a value outside the allowed set or uses an unhashable dictionary key
- **THEN** discovery fails

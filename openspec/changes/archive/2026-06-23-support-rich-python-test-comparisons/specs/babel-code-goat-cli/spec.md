## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Supported command interface
The system SHALL provide a root-level `babel_code_goat.py` CLI with `generate <tests_dir> --entrypoint <entrypoint> --lang <target_lang> [flags...]` and `test <solution_path> <tests_dir> --lang <target_lang> [flags...]` commands. The system MUST accept only `python`, `javascript`, and `typescript` as target languages. The `test` command MUST accept `--tol <float>` to set the default numeric tolerance for comparisons where tolerance is applicable.

#### Scenario: Generate accepts supported language
- **WHEN** the user runs `generate` with an existing tests directory, an entrypoint, and `--lang python`, `--lang javascript`, or `--lang typescript`
- **THEN** the command succeeds if the tests can be discovered and the tester file can be written

#### Scenario: Unsupported language is rejected
- **WHEN** the user runs `generate` or `test` with any `--lang` value other than `python`, `javascript`, or `typescript`
- **THEN** the command exits non-zero

#### Scenario: Test accepts default tolerance
- **WHEN** the user runs `test <solution_path> <tests_dir> --lang python --tol 0.001`
- **THEN** the command uses `0.001` as the default tolerance for applicable numeric comparisons in discovered tests

### Requirement: Allowed test constructs
The system SHALL support comments, allowed import statements, `def ...:` blocks at any scope, allowed assertion forms, and supported raise expectation blocks as non-comment code in `tests.py`. Each allowed assertion and each raise expectation block MUST count as one test. Allowed imports MUST be limited to imports needed for `collections.Counter`, `collections.deque`, `collections.defaultdict`, `decimal.Decimal`, `math.isclose`, and `re.search`.

#### Scenario: Equality assertion is discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains `assert ENTRYPOINT(args...) == expected`
- **THEN** the assertion is discovered as one test

#### Scenario: Inequality assertion is discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains `assert ENTRYPOINT(args...) != expected`
- **THEN** the assertion is discovered as one test

#### Scenario: Truthy assertion is discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains `assert ENTRYPOINT(args...)`
- **THEN** the assertion is discovered as one test

#### Scenario: Falsy assertion is discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains `assert not ENTRYPOINT(args...)`
- **THEN** the assertion is discovered as one test

#### Scenario: Raise-any block is discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains a `try` block that calls the entrypoint, then asserts `False`, and catches `Exception` with `pass`
- **THEN** the block is discovered as one test that passes only when the entrypoint raises an exception

#### Scenario: Typed raise block is discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains a `try` block that calls the entrypoint, then asserts `False`, and catches a specific exception type such as `ValueError`
- **THEN** the block is discovered as one test that passes only when the entrypoint raises an exception matching that type

#### Scenario: Typed raise block with substring message check is discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains a typed exception handler that asserts a string literal is contained in `str(e)`
- **THEN** the block is discovered as one test that also requires the raised exception message to contain that substring

#### Scenario: Typed raise block with regex message check is discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains a typed exception handler that asserts `re.search(<pattern>, str(e))`
- **THEN** the block is discovered as one test that also requires the raised exception message to match that regex pattern

#### Scenario: Math isclose assertion is discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains `assert math.isclose(ENTRYPOINT(args...), expected, abs_tol=abs_tol, rel_tol=rel_tol)`
- **THEN** the assertion is discovered as one test with per-assert absolute and relative tolerance metadata

#### Scenario: Absolute difference tolerance assertion is discovered
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains `assert abs(ENTRYPOINT(args...) - expected) < tol` or `assert abs(ENTRYPOINT(args...) - expected) <= tol`
- **THEN** the assertion is discovered as one test with a per-assert absolute tolerance and strictness metadata

#### Scenario: Unsupported code fails discovery
- **WHEN** `tests.py` contains non-comment code outside the allowed constructs
- **THEN** discovery fails

### Requirement: Allowed values and equality
The system SHALL support `None`, booleans, integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries with any supported key type, sets, frozensets, `collections.Counter`, `collections.deque`, `collections.defaultdict`, and `decimal.Decimal` as allowed argument and expected values. Nested allowed values MUST be supported. Equality and inequality checks MUST use deep structural comparison for nested containers according to each container's meaning.

#### Scenario: Nested values compare structurally
- **WHEN** a discovered assertion compares nested allowed containers returned by the entrypoint
- **THEN** the test result is based on deep structural equality

#### Scenario: Dictionary keys use supported key semantics
- **WHEN** a discovered assertion uses a dictionary with non-string supported keys such as integers, tuples, booleans, or `Decimal` values
- **THEN** discovery succeeds and comparison preserves key identity according to the supported key values

#### Scenario: Sets and frozensets compare unordered contents
- **WHEN** a discovered assertion compares a `set` or `frozenset` value returned by the entrypoint
- **THEN** the test result is based on unordered membership rather than insertion or serialization order

#### Scenario: Counter values compare counts
- **WHEN** a discovered assertion compares a `collections.Counter` value returned by the entrypoint
- **THEN** the test result is based on the counter's element counts

#### Scenario: Deque values compare ordered contents
- **WHEN** a discovered assertion compares a `collections.deque` value returned by the entrypoint
- **THEN** the test result is based on the deque's ordered contents

#### Scenario: Defaultdict values compare mapping contents
- **WHEN** a discovered assertion compares a `collections.defaultdict` value returned by the entrypoint
- **THEN** the test result is based on mapping contents and does not require matching default factory identity

#### Scenario: Decimal values participate in numeric comparison
- **WHEN** a discovered assertion compares a `decimal.Decimal` value with another numeric supported value
- **THEN** the test result is based on numeric value semantics, including tolerance where applicable

#### Scenario: Unsupported literal fails discovery
- **WHEN** an argument or expected value is outside the allowed value set
- **THEN** discovery fails

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Tolerance-aware numeric comparisons
The system SHALL apply the `test --tol <float>` default tolerance to equality and inequality comparisons where both compared values are numeric or nested numeric values. Per-assert tolerance overrides from `math.isclose(...)` and supported `abs(a - b)` assertions MUST override the default tolerance for that assertion.

#### Scenario: Default tolerance applies to nested floats
- **WHEN** a discovered equality assertion compares nested containers that contain floats differing by no more than the `--tol` value
- **THEN** the test passes for those numeric leaves

#### Scenario: Default tolerance does not change nonnumeric equality
- **WHEN** a discovered equality assertion compares strings, booleans, or container structure
- **THEN** the test uses exact structural semantics for those nonnumeric values

#### Scenario: Math isclose overrides default tolerance
- **WHEN** a discovered `math.isclose` assertion specifies `abs_tol` or `rel_tol`
- **THEN** the test uses those per-assert tolerances instead of the `--tol` default

#### Scenario: Absolute difference strictness is preserved
- **WHEN** a discovered absolute-difference assertion uses `< tol`
- **THEN** a difference exactly equal to `tol` fails

#### Scenario: Absolute difference inclusive comparison is preserved
- **WHEN** a discovered absolute-difference assertion uses `<= tol`
- **THEN** a difference exactly equal to `tol` passes

### Requirement: Typed raise and message matching
The system SHALL support raise expectation blocks that require a specific exception type and optionally require the raised exception message to contain a substring or match a regex. Raise expectation blocks without a specific type MUST continue to pass when any exception is raised.

#### Scenario: Typed exception match passes
- **WHEN** a discovered typed raise expectation catches `ValueError` and the entrypoint raises `ValueError`
- **THEN** the test passes

#### Scenario: Wrong exception type fails
- **WHEN** a discovered typed raise expectation catches `ValueError` and the entrypoint raises `TypeError`
- **THEN** the test fails

#### Scenario: Message substring match passes
- **WHEN** a discovered typed raise expectation asserts `"bad" in str(e)` and the raised exception message contains `bad`
- **THEN** the test passes the message check

#### Scenario: Message substring mismatch fails
- **WHEN** a discovered typed raise expectation asserts `"bad" in str(e)` and the raised exception message does not contain `bad`
- **THEN** the test fails

#### Scenario: Regex message match passes
- **WHEN** a discovered typed raise expectation asserts `re.search(r"bad", str(e))` and the raised exception message matches the pattern
- **THEN** the test passes the message check

#### Scenario: Regex message mismatch fails
- **WHEN** a discovered typed raise expectation asserts `re.search(r"bad", str(e))` and the raised exception message does not match the pattern
- **THEN** the test fails
